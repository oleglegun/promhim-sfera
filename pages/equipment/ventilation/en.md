**Premises ventilation** is a constant replacement of an air exhausted
during the process of human life activity. Ventilation consists of air
removal through the exhaust air line system and fresh air inlet from the
outside using the same system but through the inlet channels. Sometimes
the ambient air is additionally treated by special filters to improve
its quality.

In the first place, ventilation of premises, both manufacturing and
industrial, is the way of maintaining a constant temperature and
humidity inside the premises. When a human is in the premises, his body
generates heat and humidity changes as well. That is why premises
ventilation must be of the highest quality. It is necessary to design a
ventilation system prior to its installation. Indeed, premises
ventilation will be ineffective without precision computation, which
includes taking into consideration all the parameters.

Parameters affecting the premises ventilation design:
* Number of people in the premises,
* Floor space,
* Airspace,
* Ceiling height,
* Time which people spend in the premises,
* Premise occupancy level,
* Category of works performed in the premises,
* Additional coefficients.

**Manufacturing premises ventilation** can be the same as **industrial
premises ventilation** in terms of design concept, since the
manufacturing and industrial premises may be of the same size. Even if
they are different in size, the system layout may remain the same. Only
the parameters affecting power calculation for the ventilation and its
accessories (fans, valves, line cross-section size) will change.
