JSC PKF "PromHim-Sfera" offers a wide range of **Rohrback Cosasco Systems**
products for corrosion monitoring:
* The main factor at selection of corrosion monitoring equipment by RCS
  is its wide range of applications: from observation of the actual
  pipeline wall thickness to identification of corrosion processes
  affecting factors.
* Industrial application of the RCS systems allows to respond
  immediately to any changes in the operating process reducing the risks
  of corrosion.

A distinguishing feature of probes with flat working surface is a
possibility of flush mounting with pipeline wall. The undeniable
advantage of using this type of probe is a possibility of application on
pipelines, which has to be cleaned with pigs periodically.



## Quick Sand Erosion Sensor ![Corrosion monitoring](./corrosion-01.jpg){.width-20 .alignright}

The unique advantage of the Quick Sand sensors is a possibility of
evaluation of two corrosion processes - erosion process (abrasive wear)
and corrosion.

The Quick Sand sensor allows to evaluate swiftly the negative impact of
mechanical impurities on the most hazardous sections of pipeline.
